<h1 align="center"> Personal Blog </h1>

<p align="center">
This project is a fully functional personal blog platform built with Django, featuring a clean front-end and a powerful admin interface for managing posts. It supports CRUD operations, tag-based filtering, and pagination, allowing users to browse articles by category or recency. The backend leverages Djangoâ€™s templating engine, ORM, and admin panel, while the front-end is styled with HTML/CSS and enriched using JavaScript for smooth navigation. This blog system serves as a solid foundation for deploying personal or professional content platforms.
